${generateCategoryContent(category, prompt, context)}

## M3-Agent Insights
- **Memory Integration**: Content generated with reference to stored knowledge graphs
- **Multimodal Reasoning**: Enhanced understanding through visual and contextual processing
- **Adaptive Generation**: Personalized content based on interaction patterns
- **Long-term Memory**: Content that builds upon previous generations and user preferences

## Technical Specifications
- **Agent Framework**: M3-Agent with long-term memory
- **Processing Mode**: ${mode === 'smart' ? 'Intelligent analysis with memory retrieval' : 'Direct generation with context awareness'}
- **Memory Graphs**: Entity-centric multimodal knowledge representation
- **Reasoning Depth**: Multi-turn iterative reasoning with memory retrieval
